<h1>eaglercraft-server</h1>
Following the legacy of <a href="https://github.com/@ayunami2000">@ayunami2000</a>, a working replit eaglercraft-server with no missing items really.
Some differences are this uses an apache webserver rather than nginx, and this server doesn't actually update, So I smashed in eaglercraft 1.5.2 service pack 1.01.
